## Introduction to project

The global sports betting markets have grown at a phenomenal rate in recent years due to broad deregulation, the removal of national monopolies, and, more importantly, the introduction of online gambling. Like every other industry, technology had a major influence on sports betting, in which companies have digitized and simplified their platforms to provide a pleasurable experience. Due to its economic importance and similarity to the financial market, the betting market has attracted much attention from academia, and some have studied the efficiency of the betting market. Some interesting results showed that betting odds in some betting markets failed to update their expectations.

This is considered a violation of semi-strong market efficiency. With this flaw in the betting market, this paper researches the possibility of exploiting the betting market inefficiencies by using some machine learning techniques. This research is relevant to bookmaker companies since it may give them a better understanding of the betting market and its loopholes, which might help them avoid revenue losses. Additionally, this research can help bookmakers better understand the potential risks and challenges associated with using machine learning in sports betting and how to mitigate these risks and challenges.
